# C-Lee-s-algorithm

This is a C++ implementation of Lee's pathfinding algorithm.
The algorithm reads from a file called alee.in the coordinates of the walls(areas which cannot be traversed), then the start zone coordinates and end zone coordinates, respectively.
The algorithm then outputs to a file called alee.out the shortest distance from the start to the end.
